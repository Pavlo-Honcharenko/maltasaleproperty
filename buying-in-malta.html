					<div class="step-by-step__text">
						<p>While property can be purchased directly from a vendor (owner) as a non-Maltese citizen it is
							advisable to work with a registered and accredited Real Estate Agency that can connect you with an
							experienced and qualified agent to assist you in finding a home that best suits your needs.</p>

							Duty Fees associated with the purchase of a property. If there is a bank loan involved, then the
							final deed will be signed at the Bank’s office.</p>
						<p>It is important to note that if the property is located outside of a Special Designated Area (SDA)
							also known as a Lifestyle Development and you are a non-EU citizen or are an EU citizen who has
							been living in Malta for less than five years then before you can sign the promise of sale, you
							will need to apply and acquire an AIP permit which will give you the right to buy your property.

						What are the Costs & Fees when Purchasing a Property in Malta?
					</div>

					<div class="cost__subtitle">
						Architect Fees
					</div>
					<div class="cost__text">
						<p>You need an architect to inspect your property and make sure it’s in good order. You also need the
							architect to get you a site plan and fill out bank documents if you take a home loan. Architect
							fees are usually between €200 and €500. Once you have signed the final deed and taken ownership of
							your property the only fees left to pay are your Stamp Duty, Notary Fees and Estate Agency Fees.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="cost__subtitle">
						Stamp Duty
					</div>
					<div class="cost__text">
						<p>Stamp duty could be considered a form of property tax in Malta. Malta stamp duty is calculated at
							5% of the value of the immovable property. 1% is payable upon signing the promise of sale and the
							remaining 4% is payable upon the final signing of the final deed of sale.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="cost__subtitle">
						Notary Fees
					</div>
					<div class="cost__text">
						<p>Notary fees are paid to the notary for preparing all the necessary documentation for the promise of
							sale and the final deed of sale. The Notary carries out all due diligence checks necessary to
							ensure the successful sale and transfer of the property. Notary fees are usually 2 – 2.5% of the
							total value of the property.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="cost__subtitle">
						Energy Performance Certificate (EPC)
					</div>
					<div class="cost__text">
						<p>An EPC certificate would need to be applied for. This is the responsibility of the Seller and is
							obtained from an Energy Performance of Buildings (EPB) assessor</p>
					</div>

					<div class="cost__subtitle">
						Estate Agency Fees
					</div>
					<div class="cost__text">
						<p>The majority of Real Estate Agencies in Malta charge a 5% + 18% vat fee of the property purchase
							price. This would be already included in the price when advertised on social media.</p>

							<div class="article__text">
								<p>A Special Designated Area (SDA) is a particular status that is granted to a development of
									apartments, houses, villas, and penthouses within Malta or Gozo. </p>

								<p>Under the terms of the status, the houses can be purchased by both EU and non-EU citizens
									without the need for an AIP permit. This means the individual can purchase as many homes as
									they wish, and they can also rent them out as they deem fit, without any issues. </p>

								<p>
									These developments are extremely popular, not merely due to the administrative benefits.
									They are predominantly high-end, luxurious complexes that are in desirable areas served by
									many amenities. Most offer resident-only swimming pools, gyms, parking, security and CCTV,
									shops, and car-free zones.
								</p>

								<p>Properties in SDA’s provide a smart investment, a superior standard of living, and impeccable
									and stylish surroundings in Malta’s most sought-after areas.</p>

							<div class="article__title">AIP Permit - Acquisition of Immovable Property </div>
							<div class="article__text">
								<p>Non-EU/Malta residents who wish to acquire property in Malta must obtain a permit for the
									acquisition of immovable property (AIP). This permit allows non-residents to purchase
									property in Malta, subject to a number of conditions.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="article__title">
								How to apply for the AIP permit?</div>
							<div class="article__text">
								<p>After identifying the immovable property which they wish to purchase, the buyer will then
									enter a ‘convenium’- a written agreement. A copy of this must be attached to the AIP
									application form which can be collected from the Capital Transfer Duty Department of the
									Inland Revenue Division. The fee payable on the issue of a permit is €233 and is independent
									of the value of the property being transferred. The permit will be issued within 35 days,
									provided that the application is correct as per its Quality Service Charter.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="article__title">Conditions when applying for the
								AIP permit</div>
							<div class="article__text">
								<p>To apply for the AIP, the applicant must purchase an apartment or maisonette for a minimum of
									€143,410, or €247,701 for the purchase of any other immovable property. If the property is
									bought unconverted or in shell form, then the minimum value must include the costs of
									finishing. </p>
